# Trump Truth Social archive scraper

This repository contains a Python script that scrapes posts from Donald Trump's Truth Social account and stores them in JSON and CSV formats. The scraper runs hourly via a GitHub Actions workflow and updates an S3 archive to keep a historical record of the posts. 

## How it works

### Fetching data from Truth Social API

The script (`scraper.py`) fetches posts directly from the Truth Social API using a proxy service (`ScrapeOps`) to ensure successful requests.

- **Pagination support:** It requests up to 100 new posts in batches of 20.
- **Media extraction:** Any images or videos in a post are extracted and stored as an array of URLs.
- **Duplicate handling:** Before adding new posts, the script checks an existing archive to avoid duplicates.

## Data output format

The scraper outputs posts in JSON format with the following structure:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "114132050804394743",
    "created_at": "2025-03-09T10:41:28.605Z",
    "content": "Will be interviewed by Maria Bartiromo on Sunday Morning Futures at 10:00amET, enjoy! <span class=\"h-card\"><a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@FoxNews\" class=\"u-url mention\">@<span>FoxNews</span></a></span>",
    "url": "https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114132050804394743",
    "media": [
      "https://static-assets-1.truthsocial.com/tmtg:prime-ts-assets/media_attachments/files/114/132/050/631/878/172/original/f0e7d14a580b0bc6.mp4"
    ],
    "replies_count": 925,
    "reblogs_count": 2938,
    "favourites_count": 13166
  },
  {
    "id": "114130744626893259",
    "created_at": "2025-03-09T05:09:17.893Z",
    "content": "",
    "url": "https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114130744626893259",
    "media": [
      "https://static-assets-1.truthsocial.com/tmtg:prime-ts-assets/media_attachments/files/114/130/744/449/958/273/original/56b8a2c4e789ede9.jpg"
    ],
    "replies_count": 2451,
    "reblogs_count": 3833,
    "favourites_count": 16848
  },
]
```

### Field descriptions

- **`id`** → The unique identifier for the post
- **`created_at`** → Timestamp when the post was made
- **`content`** → The text content of the post
- **`url`** → Direct link to the post on Truth Social
- **`media`** → An array of image and video URLs if the post contains media
- **`replies_count`** → Number of replies to Trump post
- **`reblogs_count`** → Number of re-posts, or re-truths, to Trump post
- **`favourites_count`** → Number of favorites to Trump post

## GitHub Actions automation

The scraper runs every four hours at 47 minutes past. It's using a GitHub Actions workflow and environment secrets for AWS and ScrapeOps. In addition to fetching the data, the workflow also copies it to a designated S3 bucket. 

*Note: I'm considering strategies now for periodically rehydrating the archive with updated engeagement analytics (re-posts, replies, etc.) so that we capture changes over time for popular posts.*

### Workflow steps

1. Clone the repository
2. Set up Python and install required dependencies
3. Run `scraper.py` to fetch the latest posts
4. Save new posts and update `truth_archive.json`
5. Upload the updated JSON file to an S3 bucket (`stilesdata.com/trump-truth-social-archive/`)
6. Commit and push changes back to GitHub

## Installation and running locally

To run the scraper manually on your machine:

### Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Set environment variables

You'll need to export your ScrapeOps API key and AWS credentials:

```bash
export SCRAPE_PROXY_KEY="your_scrapeops_api_key"
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your_aws_key"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your_aws_secret"
```

### Run the scraper

```bash
python scraper.py
```

This will fetch new posts and update `truth_archive.json` and `truth_archive.csv`.

## Deployment

The script is fully automated via GitHub Actions. To update or change the workflow:

- Modify `.github/workflows/trump-truth-social-archive.yml`
- Push changes to GitHub
- The workflow will execute on the next scheduled run

## Data storage and access

- Historical posts are stored in an S3 bucket:
  - [`truth_archive.json`](https://stilesdata.com/trump-truth-social-archive/truth_archive.json)
  - [`truth_archive.csv`](https://stilesdata.com/trump-truth-social-archive/truth_archive.csv)

- The latest version of these files is also stored in this repo and updated regularly.

This project is for archival and research purposes only. Use responsibly. It is not affiliated with my employer.

### Next steps and improvements:

- Better flags for original posts vs. retweets
- Better handling of media-only posts
- Improve media handling (support for more formats)
- Implement error logging for better monitoring
- Better analytics: Keywords, classification, etc. 
- Consider front-end display or Slack integration to help news teams monitor posts
